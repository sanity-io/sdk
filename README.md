  <h1 align="center">Sanity App SDK</h1>
</p>

The Sanity App SDK is a robust set of tooling that will let you create fully custom apps that interface and interact with your Sanity content. It brings the powerful real-time capabilities and content management features you know from Sanity Studio to your own custom React applications. With a comprehensive set of React hooks and data stores, you can easily build applications that work seamlessly with your Sanity content across multiple projects and datasets.

Developers can use the SDK to harness enterprise-grade platform capabilities — such as real-time content synchronization, collaborative editing, and permissions management — out of the box and with minimal complexity, unlocking powerful new workflows across their organization.

The Sanity App SDK exposes these platform capabilities via a set of concise, composable React hooks. These programmable building blocks can be used to build out entire custom applications (backed by your choice of UI components or styling solution), while the Sanity CLI makes the creation and deployment of these applications fast and effortless.
