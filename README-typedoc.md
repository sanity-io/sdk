Welcome to the reference docs for the Sanity App SDK!

The App SDK is a toolkit for building custom React applications that interact with your Sanity content. It provides a set of React hooks and data stores that enable real-time content operations, seamlessly handling content from multiple projects and datasets, and with complete freedom to create your own interfaces and experiences.

## ðŸ¥‡ First steps

If this is your first time using the App SDK, we recommend starting with the **[conceptual overview and getting started guide on the Sanity Docs site](https://sanity.io/docs/app-sdk)**, where youâ€™ll find a general orientation and a step by step walkthrough for creating your first custom app with the App SDK.

## ðŸ“š Reference docs

Once youâ€™re up and running with your first app, our reference docs (presented here!) will help you understand how to work with each of the React hooks and other functionality provided by the App SDK.

You can browse all of the reference docs using the navigation sidebar on the left (or in the menu at the top of the screen if youâ€™re viewing this on a smaller device).

At present, our focus is on our React SDK, which enables users to compose app functionality using React hooks. The Core SDK â€” written entirely in Typescript â€” is provided primarily as the backbone of the React SDKâ€™s functionality, and for users building their own SDKs. As such, we suggest that the React SDK reference docs should be your primary point of reference here.

## ðŸ§± Example implementations

**[The SDK Explorer](https://sdk-examples.sanity.dev)** is a collection of example implementations built using our React SDK. Youâ€™ll find functional demonstrations of using the App SDKâ€™s React hooks in combination with various styling methodologies to create UI patterns both familiar and new, in addition to the source code for each implementation, which youâ€™re free to use in your own projects.
