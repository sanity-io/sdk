- Follow all `general-monorepo-guidelines`.
- This package provides core, framework-agnostic logic and utilities. Do **not** introduce React-specific dependencies or concepts here.
- Ensure code is well-documented with TSDoc comments.
- Tests utilize Vitest. Focus on unit testing individual functions and classes.
