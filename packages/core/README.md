  <h1 align="center">Sanity App SDK (Core)</h1>
</p>

The App SDK Core is a pure TypeScript implementation of the App SDK’s business logic. It powers our React App SDK under the hood, and leaves the door open for future framework specific implementations, too.

We highly recommend that users default to using the hooks provided by the React SDK for building custom apps on the Sanity platform, unless you’re looking to create your own Sanity App SDK using this core layer.

**Looking for our React SDK?** You’ll find it on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/sanity-io/sdk/tree/main/packages/react)
- [Sanity Docs](https://sanity.io/docs/app-sdk)
- [App SDK (React) reference docs](https://reference.sanity.io/_sanity/sdk-react)
