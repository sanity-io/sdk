# SDK E2E testing

## Required Env Variables

The tests expect to find the below env variables. Either define them in your shell, or add them to the `.env.local` file in the repository root.

-- `SDK_E2E_SESSION_TOKEN`: The client fixture needs to use this token. Running `SANITY_INTERNAL_ENV=staging sanity debug --secrets` will give you your token provided you are logged in (`SANITY_INTERNAL_ENV=staging sanity login`).

- `SDK_E2E_PROJECT_ID`: We use 3j6vt2rg internally
- `SDK_E2E_ORGANIZATION_ID`: We use oFvj4MZWQ internally
- `SDK_E2E_USER_ID`: sdk+e2e@sanity.io
- `SDK_E2E_USER_PASSWORD`: found in 1Password
- `RECAPTCHA_E2E_STAGING_KEY`: found in 1Password
- `SDK_E2E_DATASET_0`=production
- `SDK_E2E_DATASET_1`=testing

## Writing tests

@repo/e2e provides a specialized fixture for your tests, called `getPageContext`. This is because the tests run both standalone and in the Dashboard, meaning locators work a bit differently. Please use this fixture to ensure your tests work well in both environments. To do so, you should write your tests so that they do the following:

1. Navigate to the route you intend to test on, i.e., `await page.goto('./my-route')` (otherwise Playwright will be at about:blank and not know anything about iframes or not)
2. Use the `getPageContext` function with your page, like `const pageContext = await getPageContext(page)`
3. Use the locators provided by `pageContext`, like `const button = pageContext.getByTestId('my-button')

Here is a full example:

```ts
import {expect, test} from '@repo/e2e'

test('can click a button', async ({page, getPageContext}) => {
  await page.goto('./button-test-page')

  const pageContext = await getPageContext(page)

  await pageContext.getByTestId('my-button').click()
})
```

## Running tests

To run E2E tests run the following commands from the root of the project

- Run all the tests

  ```sh
  pnpm test:e2e
  ```

- Run files that have my-spec or my-spec-2 in the file name

  ```sh
  pnpm test:e2e -- my-spec my-spec-2
  ```

- For help, run
  ```sh
  pnpm test:e2e -- --help
  ```

Other useful helper commands

- "dev:e2e": Starts the Kitchensink pointing to the E2E project and dataset. This server can be used by both you as a developer and the e2e tests at the same time for debugging purposes.

For more useful commands, see the [Playwright Command Line](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli) documentation.

### Running tests from your code editor

You can run your tests in your editor with the help of some useful editor plugins/extensions. For example, you can download `Playwright Test for VSCode` from Microsoft to show and run your tests in VSCode.

### Running in CI mode

These tests run in CI with a built application (rather than dev server). It also runs its tests in the Dashboard. If you'd like to replicate that, you should add the following variables to your .env.local file:

- `CI`: true
