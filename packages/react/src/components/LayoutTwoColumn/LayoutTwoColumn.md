# LayoutTwoColumn

The LayoutTwoColumn component provides a simple two-column layout with equal width columns. It's useful for creating side-by-side content layouts that don't need to collapse. Grid and children are set to 100% height of the parent. It offloads alignment to the children to structure their own internal layout.
