# LayoutTwoColumnCollapse

The LayoutTwoColumnCollapse component provides a responsive two-column layout that collapses to a single column on smaller screens (below 680px). When space allows, it displays equal width columns. Grid and children are set to 100% height of the parent. It offloads alignment to the children to structure their own internal layout.
